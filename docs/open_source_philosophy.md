# Open Source Philosophy

Symnix is built on a foundation of open source technologies that power the
modern web.
We recognize the immense value these projects bring to the development community
and strive to give back in meaningful ways.

While the core code of Symnix remains closed-source for now, we are committed to
supporting the open source ecosystem in several ways:

### Sharing:

We open source selected tools, libraries, and utilities developed by our team
that can be helpful to others. By making these resources publicly available,
we aim to contribute to the broader developer community and enable innovation
beyond our own platform. You can explore our open source contributions
[here â§‰](https://github.com/orgs/symnixhq/repositories).

### Collaborating with the Community:

We try to actively contribute to some of the open source projects that we depend
on by
submitting merge requests, reporting bugs, and helping to improve features.
This collaboration not only strengthens the tools we rely on but also ensures
their continued success for everyone.

Our commitment to open source reflects our belief in fostering a culture of
collaboration and innovation. We encourage others to engage with open source,
whether by contributing code, supporting maintainers, or simply sharing
knowledge.
