## What is Symnix?

Symnix is a platform that makes it easy to setup, manage and secure web applications on your own environment. It doesn't matter which provider you host your server with because you do not need to install a client on your system.

You can install web apps directly from your browser with Symnix. In the meantime, Symnix automates all the task required for the installation, certificate management or backups.

Symnix offers a centralized way to organize users or organizations through granular permission management.

## Why Symnix?

We offer a wide range of different services that can be deployed. To start a deployment, you only need to specify a target host and define a few variables. Our application then takes over the deployment of the desired application. Check the [Getting Started â§‰](getting_started.md) section to deploy your first application.
